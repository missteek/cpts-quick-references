# Tools of the Trade

Many of the module sections require tools such as open-source scripts or precompiled binaries. Where applicable, these can be found in the `C:\Tools` directory on the Windows hosts provided in the sections aimed at attacking from Windows. In sections that focus on attacking AD from Linux we provide a Parrot Linux host customized for the target environment as if you were an anonymous user with an attack box within the internal network. All necessary tools and scripts will be preloaded on this host.  Here is a listing of many of the tools that we will cover in this module:
  
| Tool              | Description |  
| ----------------- | ----------- |  
| [PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1)/[SharpView](https://github.com/dmchell/SharpView) | A PowerShell tool and a .NET port of the same used to gain situational awareness in AD. These tools can be used as replacements for various Windows `net*` commands and more. PowerView and SharpView can help us gather much of the data that BloodHound does, but it requires more work to make meaningful relationships among all of the data points. These tools are great for checking what additional access we may have with a new set of credentials, targeting specific users or computers, or finding some "quick wins" such as users that can be attacked via Kerberoasting or ASREPRoasting. |  
| [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) | Used to visually map out AD relationships and help plan attack paths that may otherwise go unnoticed. Uses the [SharpHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/tree/master/Ingestors) PowerShell or C# ingestor to gather data to later be imported into the BloodHound JavaScript (Electron) application with a [Neo4j](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/tree/master/Ingestors) database for graphical analysis of the AD environment. |  
| [SharpHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/tree/master/Collectors) | The C# data collector to gather information from Active Directory about varying AD objects such as users, groups, computers, ACLs, GPOs, user and computer attributes, user sessions, and more. The tool produces JSON files which can then be ingested into the BloodHound GUI tool for analysis. |  
| [BloodHound.py](https://github.com/fox-it/BloodHound.py) |  A Python-based BloodHound ingestor based on the [Impacket toolkit](https://github.com/CoreSecurity/impacket/).
